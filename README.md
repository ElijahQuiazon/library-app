<h1>Library App</h1>

<h2>Brief overview</h2>
This is a library application that I'm currently working on to better understand how to use the <strong>express backend framework</strong>. I'm using the mdn web docs tutorial to guide my learning.

<h2>Learning progress</h2>
While challenging, this project has enriched my knowledge of the following web development and JavaScript concepts:
<ul>
    <li>Synchronous and asynchronous functions</li>
    <li>Objects, methods and properties</li>
    <li>The DNS Hierarchy</li>
    <li>Client-side and server-side programming</li>
    <li>Using libraries, modules and dependencies</li>
    <li>Connecting to databases</li>
</ul>
