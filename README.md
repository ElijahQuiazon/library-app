<h1>Library App</h1>

<h2>Brief overview</h2>
This is a library application that I'm currently working on to better understand how to use the <strong>express backend framework</strong>. I'm using the mdn web docs tutorial to guide my learning.

<h2>Learning progress</h2>
Thus far, this project has reinforced my understanding of the following concepts:
<ul>
    <li>Javascript objects</li>
    <li>Frameworks and libraries</li>
    <li>Databases</li>
</ul>
